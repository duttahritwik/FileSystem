# In Memory File System Simulation

This is a simulation of an in-memory file system implemented in C++. The file system allocates a large chunk of memory and manages the allocation of memory for incoming files using the first fit strategy. The simulation also includes functionality to read from and write to files, as well as delete the contents of a file. The directory structure and subdirectories are taken into account for memory allocation and other operations.

# Features

-Dynamic allocation of memory for incoming files using the first fit strategy
-Ability to create, read, write, and delete files within the in-memory file system
-Support for directory structure and subdirectories
-Efficient memory management to optimize memory allocation and utilization

# Technologies Used

-C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
